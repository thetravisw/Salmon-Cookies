    <h1>Pike Place Market</h1>
    <p>Pike Place Market is a public market overlooking the Elliott Bay waterfront in Seattle, Washington, United States. The
        Market opened August 17, 1907, and is one of the oldest continuously operated public farmers' markets in the United
        States. It is a place of business for many small farmers, craftspeople and merchants. Named after the central street,
        Pike Place runs northwest from Pike Street to Virginia Street. With more than 10 million visitors annually, Pike
        Place Market is Seattle's most popular tourist destination and is the 33rd most visited tourist attraction in the
        world.

    <h1>Alki Beach</h1>
    >
    <p>West Seattle is an oft overlooked part of Seattle that offers one of the few destination beaches on Puget Sound. Alki
        Beach has a two and a half mile long pedestrian walkway, and in the summer is populated by beach volleyball players,
        sun worshipers, and beachcombers. Most of the beaches on Puget Sound are covered in rock and shells, but on Alki
        you can get sand between your toes, get some exercise, learn about Seattle’s earliest settlers, and take in a great
        view of the Seattle skyline. ~~~

    <h1>Space Needle</h1>
    <p>The Space Needle is an observation tower in Seattle, Washington, a landmark of the Pacific Northwest, and an icon of
        Seattle. It was built in the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair, which drew over 2.3 million visitors, when
        nearly 20,000 people a day used its elevators.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River,[7] it is 605 ft (184 m) high, 138 ft (42 m) wide, and weighs
        9,550 short tons (8,660 tonnes). It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour (89 m/s; 320 km/h) and
        earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude. ~~~

    <h1>Capitol Hill</h1>
    <p>Just east of downtown, find a colorful, urban scene where many streets boast a metropolitan buzz and others emanate a
        tree-lined, residential calm. This is the city’s LGBTQ hub, but visitors and locals of all sorts flock to Capitol
        Hill.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Global flavors rule this eclectic neighborhood, where can’t-miss dishes include grilled octopus at Mediterranean oasis
        Omega Ouzeri, the chile cumin pork ribs at Vietnamese-French Stateside, and the tajarin al ragu (finely cut egg pasta)
        at Northern Italian gem Cascina Spinasse. You also won’t want to shy away from Mamnoon’s exquisite décor and modern
        Middle Eastern cuisine, and you certainly won’t want to overlook its muhammara dip (walnuts, pepper paste, cumin,
        garlic, pomegranate). Bar Vacilando fuels wanderlust with adventurous eats; begin with the prosciutto and béchamel
        crusts, followed by the salt cod croquettes. ~~~
