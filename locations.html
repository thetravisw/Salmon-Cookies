    <h1>Pike Place Market</h1>
    <p>Pike Place Market is a public market overlooking the Elliott Bay waterfront in Seattle, Washington, United States. The Market opened August 17, 1907, and is one of the oldest continuously operated public farmers' markets in the United States. It is a place of business for many small farmers, craftspeople and merchants. Named after the central street, Pike Place runs northwest from Pike Street to Virginia Street. With more than 10 million visitors annually, Pike Place Market is Seattle's most popular tourist destination and is the 33rd most visited tourist attraction in the world.  ~~ www.wikipedia.com</p>

     <h1>Alki Beach</h1>
>    <p>West Seattle is an oft overlooked part of Seattle that offers one of the few destination beaches on Puget Sound. Alki Beach has a two and a half mile long pedestrian walkway, and in the summer is populated by beach volleyball players, sun worshipers, and beachcombers. Most of the beaches on Puget Sound are covered in rock and shells, but on Alki you can get sand between your toes, get some exercise, learn about Seattle’s earliest settlers, and take in a great view of the Seattle skyline. ~~~  http://seattletravel.com/activities/alki-beach/</p>
