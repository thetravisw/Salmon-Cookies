## Salmon Kookies

**Author**  Travis Williams
**Version**: 1.0.3

## Overview
My home-girl pat thinks she's gonna get rich selling Salmon Cookies to tourists.  She's an idiot, but I built her a website anyways... largely because she's imaginary and this is a class project.   We're tracking sales (randomized) and providing a front-facing UI.
